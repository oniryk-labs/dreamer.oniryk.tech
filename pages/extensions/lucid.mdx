## Lucid Extensions

### UUID Support

The `withUUID` extension adds UUID support to your models. It's based on the concept of using UUID as a key to expose externally while keeping an autoincrementing integer as the primary key.

```typescript
import { BaseModel } from '@adonisjs/lucid/orm'
import { compose } from '@adonisjs/core/helpers'
import { withUUID } from '@oniryk/dreamer/extensions/lucid'

export default class Post extends compose(BaseModel, withUUID()) {
  //...
}
```

**What's changed under the hood?**

- `id` column keeps existing as primary key to speed up relationship queries
- `uuid` column is defined and autogenerates UUIDs for new records
- changes the default behavior of `find` and `findOrFail` methods to use the `uuid` column instead of `id` when making queries

### Soft-delete Support

The `withSoftDelete` extension implements soft delete functionality in your models:
* Adds a `deletedAt` timestamp column to your model
* Automatically filters out soft-deleted records from queries

```typescript
import { BaseModel } from '@adonisjs/lucid/orm'
import { compose } from '@adonisjs/core/helpers'
import { withSoftDelete } from '@oniryk/dreamer/extensions/lucid'

export default class Post extends compose(BaseModel, withSoftDelete()) {
  // ...
}
```

### Searchable Fields

The searchable fields feature allows you to define which fields can be searched in your models:
* Define exact match fields (e.g., 'author_id')
* Define partial match fields using the 'like:' prefix (e.g., 'like:title')
* Automatically handles search queries in the CRUD index operation
* Supports multiple search criteria in a single query

```typescript
import { BaseModel } from '@adonisjs/lucid/orm'
import { compose } from '@adonisjs/core/helpers'
import { withSoftDelete } from '@oniryk/dreamer/extensions/lucid'

export default class Post extends BaseModel {
  public static searchable = ['author_id', 'like:title']
}
```
