### Advanced Features

#### Custom Actions
You can specify which CRUD actions to generate using the `--actions` flag:

```bash
node ace dreamer posts --actions=index,show
```

Available actions:
- `index` (List all)
- `show` (View single)
- `store` (Create)
- `update` (Edit)
- `destroy` (Delete)

#### Nested Resources
Dreamer supports nested resource generation for related entities. This is particularly useful for parent-child relationships:

```bash
node ace dreamer posts/comments
```

> **Note**: Currently, dreamer doesn't have the capacity to determine relationships.
